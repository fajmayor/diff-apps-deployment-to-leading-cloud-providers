# Different Programming Apps Deployment Across 3 Leading Cloud Providers

This project aims to deploy a diverse set of 12 different programming applications to three of the most prominent cloud providers available in the market. By leveraging the capabilities of these cloud platforms, we seek to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and availability for our applications.

Through this deployment, we will explore the unique features and services offered by each cloud provider, tailoring our implementation to make the best use of their respective offerings. This will enable us to gain hands-on experience with a variety of cloud technologies and enhance our understanding of their strengths and limitations.

Our team will carefully select and configure the appropriate cloud services such as virtual machines, containers, serverless functions, and managed databases to meet the specific requirements of each programming app. Additionally, we will set up appropriate networking, security measures, and monitoring systems to ensure the applications are robust, secure, and continuously available.

By distributing the deployment across multiple cloud providers, we aim to mitigate risks associated with vendor lock-in and leverage the strengths of each provider to create a resilient and versatile infrastructure. This approach will also allow us to compare and evaluate the performance and cost-effectiveness of different cloud platforms.

Throughout the project, we will document our deployment processes, challenges faced, and lessons learned, providing valuable insights and best practices for future endeavors involving cloud-based application deployments. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve a successful and efficient deployment of the 12 programming apps, showcasing the power and versatility of cloud computing technologies.
